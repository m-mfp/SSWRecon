# SSWRecon

My new tool - also known as Safe and Slow Web Recon - for web ennumeration! It uses FFUF and FEROXBUSTER with all secure options they allow.
It is, for now, only written in bash!

To do list:
1. Perfect it!
2. Write it in Golang and Python3!


# How to use it

You need to chmod it and run it, simple as that!
It will request some input at the start.
I strongly suggest you let it run during your sleep!

Enjoy it
